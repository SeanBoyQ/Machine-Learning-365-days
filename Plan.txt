Year-Long Machine Learning Challenge
Goal: To gain proficiency in machine learning through structured learning phases, daily progress tracking, and quarterly projects, resulting in a portfolio of real-world projects by the end of the year.

Phase 1: Core Machine Learning (Months 1-3)
Objective: Build a solid foundation in essential machine learning algorithms and techniques.
Focus Areas:
Supervised Learning: Regression, classification, and decision trees
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering and dimensionality reduction
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
Milestone: Complete at least one project on a common dataset (e.g., housing prices, Titanic survival) to apply these techniques.
Progress Tracking: Document daily learnings and exercises in a public GitHub repository and share weekly progress summaries on LinkedIn or Twitter.
Phase 2: Advanced Machine Learning (Months 4-6)
Objective: Deepen knowledge with more complex algorithms and feature engineering.
Focus Areas:
Advanced Algorithms: SVMs, ensemble methods (random forests, gradient boosting)
Feature Engineering: Techniques for data preprocessing, handling missing values, and feature scaling
Model Optimization: Grid search, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation
Milestone: Complete a Kaggle competition or a larger project, focusing on using feature engineering and tuning to improve model performance.
Progress Tracking: Continue daily updates, aiming for more advanced insights and code snippets to showcase on GitHub.
Phase 3: Deep Learning and Specialized Topics (Months 7-9)
Objective: Explore deep learning and emerging areas like NLP.
Focus Areas:
Neural Networks: Introduction to neural networks, activation functions, and optimization
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
Natural Language Processing: Text preprocessing, embeddings, and sentiment analysis
Milestone: Complete a project in either image recognition or NLP (e.g., sentiment analysis, text classification).
Progress Tracking: Share progress and reflections on GitHub or a blog to track how your understanding of deep learning concepts grows.
Phase 4: Capstone Projects and Deployment (Months 10-12)
Objective: Apply your cumulative knowledge to complete portfolio-worthy projects and learn deployment techniques.
Focus Areas:
Model Deployment: Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit for serving models
Capstone Project: Design and implement a unique project (e.g., recommender system, fraud detection) from data collection to model deployment
Final Portfolio: Curate all projects, code, and documentation into a GitHub portfolio or personal website
Milestone: Deploy a machine learning model and publish your work on GitHub, LinkedIn, or a portfolio site.
Progress Tracking: Document the deployment process and insights gained in a final summary post or video reflecting on the year’s progress.
Daily Tracking & Quarterly Checkpoints
Daily Tracking: Micro-blog on GitHub, Twitter, or LinkedIn with daily reflections, code snippets, or visualizations.
Quarterly Checkpoints: Every three months, create a retrospective post or video to summarize your progress and share a major project you completed.
By the end of the year, you’ll have a clear timeline of your learning journey, a set of polished projects, and a portfolio that demonstrates your growth in machine learning!
